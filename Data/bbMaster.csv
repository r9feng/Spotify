‘cause i could draw, my uncle was, and i kept my room straight
i told my mom, tears rushing down my face
she's like, ""ben, you've loved girls since before pre-k!""
trippin', yeah i guess she had a point, didn't she?
a bunch of stereotypes all in my head
i remember doing the math like, ""yeah, i'm good at little league.""
a pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
for those that like the same sex had the characteristics
the right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
and you can be cured with some treatment and religion
man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
playing god, aw nah, here we go
america the brave still fears what we don't know
and ""god loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
but we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago

she keeps me warm
she keeps me warm
she keeps me warm
she keeps me warm
if i was gay, i would think hip-hop hates me
have you read the youtube comments lately?
""man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
we've become so numb to what we're sayin'
our culture founded from oppression
yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
a word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
it's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
the same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
it's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
live on and be yourself
when i was at church they taught me something else
if you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
that holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
when everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
i might not be the same, but that's not important
no freedom 'til we're equal, damn right i support it
and i can't change, even if i tried
even if i wanted to
my love, my love, my love
she keeps me warm
she keeps me warm
she keeps me warm
she keeps me warm
we press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
with a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'til the day that my uncles can be united by law
kids are walking 'round the hallway
plagued by a pain in their heart
a world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
and a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
but it's a damn good place to start
no law's gonna change us, we have to change us
whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
about time that we raised up!
and i can't change, even if i tried
even if i wanted to
and i can't change, even if i tried

i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jumped right in a week later, returned
i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me, ""i was never looking for a friend
maybe you could swing by my room around ten

we'll be in between the sheets till the late am""

we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
before a text message was the only way to reach her
now she's staying at my place and loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha, all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep, i guess that i don't want to either
but me and her, we make money the same way
four cities, two planes, the same day
and those shows have never been what it's about
but maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
i'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
but we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now

and i never saw him as a threat 
until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
it's not like we were both on tour
we were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun, and i thought you were different

slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
check the mirror one last time
and kiss the past goodbye

is a double shot of crown
chase that disco ball around
‘til i don’t remember
go until they cut me off
wanna get a little lost
in the noise, in the lights

‘til the party and the music and the truth collide
bring it ‘til his memory fades away
hey bartender
tonight i’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
but before it goes too far
i’ll let him down easy
cause tonight it’s all about
dancing with my girls to the dj
put that song on replay

she said ""don't you worry if i disappear""
i told her i'm not really looking for another mistake
i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jumped right in a week later, returned
i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me, ""i was never looking for a friend
maybe you could swing by my room around ten
baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
we'll be in between the sheets till the late am""
baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing
don't fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe
and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her
we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
before a text message was the only way to reach her
now she's staying at my place and loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha, all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep, i guess that i don't want to either
but me and her, we make money the same way
four cities, two planes, the same day
and those shows have never been what it's about
but maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
i'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
but we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
wish i'd have written it down, the way that things played out
when she was kissing him, how i was confused about
now she should figure it out, while i'm sat here singing
don't fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe
 on my hotel door
i don't even know if she knows what for
she was crying on my shoulder, i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next 
but you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
and i never saw him as a threat 
until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
it's not like we were both on tour
we were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun, and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realised what you wanted
it's a bit too much, too late if i'm honest
and all this time, god knows i'm singing

got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
ysl dress under when she takes the mink off
silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my 
crazy, but i love her, i could never run from her
hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
swear we drive each other, man, she be so stubborn
but, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
intense, this shit, it gets dense
she knows when i'm out of it like she could just sense
if i had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
she'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince

remember this for when i die
everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
my funeral will be lit if i-
ever go down or get caught, or they identify
my bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
she would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
ever tell you different, then it's a lie
see, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
she keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
calm and collected, she keeps her composure
and she gon' ride for me until this thing over
we do drugs together , fuck up clubs together 
and we'd both go crazy  if we was to sever
you know? we keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch

taking my sulkin' to the masses
writing my poems for the few
