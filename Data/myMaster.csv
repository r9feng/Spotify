dieu tout puissant, j’te remercie pour ma naissance
mon enfance, pour le fait que tu m’as laissé mon insouciance
j’ai connu l’essence, approcher la science, amplifié mes sens
je connais ma chance et je te la rends
désolé pour les fans, j’aime que ma foi, que ma femme
et y'a pas si longtemps, je ne m’en croyais pas capable
quand j’y pense, je pète un câble, j’aime comme a l’époque du bac à sable
l’époque des mots d’amour dans mon cartable
mais cette inconnue, mon âme sœur est devenue palpable
et je blague pas, mes sentiments sont implacables
alors j’me dis si t'es pas cap, et que j’étais irrattrapable
le malheur ne te rattrape pas, j’ai refusé le dernier appât
et rattrapé la paix, demandé pardon
maintenant fait les choses dans l’ordre, la misère s’accorde avec la miséricorde
à cette époque j’dansais, époque 95, des années hip-hop
j’voulais plaire comme un dingue
tout pour les filles, obnubilé, pour ces nébuleuses, je voulais briller les brilleuses
y m’fallait des billets, y m’fallait des filles
y fallait qu’elles défilent, c’était le défi
déficient pour le bon sens, j'étais débiteur, bourreau des cœurs
mauvaise conscience
après midi dansante, apparemment elle me dit qu’elle était là tout près de l’enceinte
qui aurait su que cette fille serait ma femme à cet instant précis
quand je l’ai vu, trop jeune, moi trop con, trop de frime
je m’en excuse ma douce, tu étais trop p'tite
je t’ai pas regardé, je t’demande pardon, j’ai failli nous rater
ce que tu m’as appris dans ta lettre
c’est que pendant les 2 ans qui suivirent cette fête
tu espérais qu’on se voit, qu’on se croise
c’est à moi que tu pensais dans ton lit le soir
moi pendant ce temps là, j’perdais mon temps à traîner en bas
devant le hall tel un zombie, j'oubliais que j'étais en vie
tu es ma muse, mon amour
je pense à toi tous les jours
je prie pour que rien ne change
sous la vigilance des anges
tu es ma nébuleuse
et je veux te rendre heureuse
ta patience pour mes faiblesses
a fait que j’ai bu l’eau céleste
donc 2 ans après, grâce à dieu on nous a représenté
je n’étais pas forcément prêt
cette idylle concrète, en fait je l’ai craint
mais t’étais juste trop belle, t’avais tout d’un ange, manquait juste les ailes
sénégal reine, tu combles le manque de mes racines africaines
la confusion d’mes sentiments, on fait de moi pendant tout ce temps
un être a moitié dément, heureusement tu nous aimais pour deux
des visions furtives, combien furent elles dans ce morceau de vie
l’amour des parents, protection de leur fille
des réminiscences de ce temps, je sens les effluves de cette frustration
j’t’ai vu grandir, tu m’as fait mûrir, ma puce, mon amour
ta patience pour nous, on fait que tous les jours je pensais à toi
mais tes parents m'voulaient pas
quelque part je les comprends
quelque part je les comprends
quelque part je les comprends
tu es ma muse, mon amour
je pense à toi tous les jours
je prie pour que rien ne change
sous la vigilance des anges
tu es ma nébuleuse
et je veux te rendre heureuse
ta patience pour mes faiblesses
a fait que j’ai bu l’eau céleste
(quand j’ai pris ma plume, j’ai écrit à son père les raisons de mon envie
lui raconte mon enfance, lui raconte ma vie
comme dans les contes demande la main de sa fille
j’augmente mon dîme, ma foi en dieu devient ultime
je parle, je pense, j’espère, je prie pour qu’il m’accepte dans sa famille)
aujourd’hui nous sommes mariés, par la grâce de dieu et ce courrier
amine, ma muse, pour chaque faute je m’excuse
pour tous les couples qui me comprennent
pour ceux qui aspirent à ça en scred
je viens vanter les bienfaits du mariage, pur, sous la vigilance des anges
pour toutes les âmes en peines, je suis droit et juste, laissez moi en paix
ma femme écoute bien cette phrase :
""lorsqu’on éduque un homme, on éduque un être
lorsqu’on éduque une femme, on éduque un peuple.""
tu es ma muse, mon amour
je pense à toi tous les jours
