Keep it buddy, they don't want no problems here
I'm feelin' like a million stacks, how the fuck you do?
Seein' how you livin', bet you probably feel a buck or two
Ho shit insured, sucker-proof, no deductible
Good neighbors with state pharmaceuticals by the bucketloads
That's Big Green like Ferrigno, if you down like feather pillows
We got wax without the earlobes, if you matchin', hold the euros
No tobacco, just the pure smoke, powdered keif lookin' like churros
If you choke up, you get higher, word to Bridget and Dinero
In a far south beach house, ashy ass, knees out
Barrin' up, beats bounce, eatin' steak and eggs 'til my feet gout
Hippy type freak outs with woke whites who beast hype
Droppin' N-words for my nigga friends only black folks can recite
That's free life, thought he wasn't when he was it
Been it from the beginnin', just gettin' better every minute
Smokin' gun, catchin' the killer and creator
Gave 'em two for one, don't thank me later
I'm tryna burn this bitch down, I ain't tryna break in
Fuck your opinion 'bout us, to me don't mean nathan
I brought the wave, brought the rain, brought the lake in
Eyes on the cake and yours is for the takin', wait man
Puffin' Michael Jordan, catch a lot of air
Shuttin' down your city, then we outta there

You got to look them in the eye

Is find the face behind the voice?

'Not today, just the choir from the radio'
'Couldn't I sit in? I've come all this way'
'Will you bugger off, I've got work to do.'

God was asleep

I would float along in my everlasting song
What would I do to believe?'"

The world could be on fire
And we wouldn't know
The temperature is rising
And no one knows
Hide behind the money
That's the way it goes
The world could be on fire
And we wouldn't know
Complaining 'bout the same things
Not watching where we're goin'
Ending up 50
Somehow with nothing
No don't listen to what they say
I admit I know that I have
Don't be the same
Don't be the same
The world could be on fire
And we wouldn't know
The temperature is rising
And no one knows
Hide behind the money
That's the way it goes
The world could be on fire
And we wouldn't know
And so it goes another day here
Passing by
I saw it waving from the window
Could you save me?
Keep takin' time, takin' your time
But there's no time left
Listen for it's almost over
Yeah
The world could be on fire
And we wouldn't know
The temperature is risin'
And no one knows
We'll hide behind the money
That's the way it goes
The world could be on fire
And we wouldn't know"

Bare were your summer
Shoulders and arms
And slender neck
She rose up beautiful before me
And bare she walks the morning anew
It is the wound she gave me
Through my heart, drives her rain
Her face under the sky is full of golden sun
I drew her through the midnight sky on iron leaves
There is no name for you
You fed me wine on a tender voyage
Within your silk, I love to forget
I step around you softly
Drown away your little hatreds
Your pain is just a memory
As your summer fruit decays
My fire for you stays
Your body is a legend
I launched into her as the earth began to die
It is within her, my name is now known
The hand draws slowly back to the poor art of my eye
These are not fingers I have
Put off your air of tragedy
The art of light on your body
Falls apart in the moonlight
Your eyes speak more than
More than you lips
More than your mouth
Bare were your summer
Shoulders and arms
And slender neck"

With a glass ceiling

In search of a pigment

Extol me
Console me

And the 80s
And the Tigris
The Euphrates

I want you to know me
I want you to throw me
In the river
So the clouds that follow my head
Can finally rain down 
On all your hydrangeas
I never had a doubt that you would come through
I always adored you 
I always ignored you
Just to make you try harder 
To you do what you do
I had to be awful  
Just to keep you from danger     
Come stand at my window 
With a view of suburbia
As it marks out the edges
Of my opulent grounds
I'm rich but I'm troubled;
There's a worm in my Bougainvillaea
Why do you plague me
When my ethics are sound?
Hold me
Scold me
Extol me
Console me
Through the 90s
And the 80s
Through the waters
Of the sea
And after all that I've said
I want you to know me
I want you to throw me

So the clouds that follow my head
Can finally rain down

To you do what you do

Just to keep you from danger

It's academia
How could I be so faithful
To the Queen of Media?
Through the 90s
And the 80s
In the AD
And the BC
Through the Xanthus
And the Yangtze
And the Niger
And the Ganges
Hold me
Fold me
Control me
Cajole me
And release me 
On the Lethe
And the ichor through my body
And after all that I've said

That I live the poetry I can not write
But you my beauty
Shall be fixed forever loosely in my heart
Do I have to shake you babe until you're blind?
'Cause every light bulb's blown and I'm feeling so inclined
Can never lay my whole head down
Can never lay my whole head down
Can never lay my whole head down

You have the eye of someone I have seen
Outside of ordinary situations
Even outside of dreams
You lie in bed at night and watch the lines of headlights through your screen
There is a child inside you who’s trying to raise a child in me
If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
You cut the flesh of your left thumb
Using your boyfriend’s knife
Seventeen, you took his cum
And you gave birth to your first life
You gave it to a family who you thought would love and take better care
I have an older brother I don’t know
He could be anywhere
If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
Rented a house in Nisswa, Minnesota
Shrapnel and oil cans, rhubarb in the yard
I built a ladder out of metal pieces
Father was working hard
Standing beneath the oak tree by the front door
You were inside baking bread
Sister came out and put her arms around me
Blood gushing from my head
You held me in the backseat with a dishrag, soaking up blood with your eyes
I was just five and you were twenty-seven
Praying, “Don’t let my baby die.”
If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
So much more to live your life
To walk the floor
To say goodnight
Do you leave your light on?
Do you leave your light on?
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way"

And spin you like a bottle baby spin you like serato

And show you as the summer fades the difference between night and day

I was looking for a man of faith
I had questions pressing on me more than not
I was looking for some answers on the spot
Two girls walked in, paperwork in hand
They were tanned from the trip
They'd seen the judge, he'd heard 'em out
Wasn't lookin' good, wasn't lookin' good for us
What about us?
But like some roadside vet with a bag in hand
I could do anything St. Peter asked
For one chance to be an angel in his eyes
It seemed to be the safe bet, so I closed my eyes
And I opened my gates wide
And St. Peter came inside
“Never, never be safe even if you're in the Gates
Give it up, you're just some man's daughter
Never, never be safe even if you're in the Gates
Give it up, you're just some man's daughter”
I promise, this is not a rumor
I asked for nothing but to stop it short
I guess he didn't hear a word I said
And after he acted as if I hadn't been in his bed
I was definitely in his bed
Peter bragged he was good at pulling out
He always knew the right time to take a bow
He practiced it every single night
It hadn't failed him yet
He'd been doing it a long, long time
And Peter just does whatever Peter likes
“Never, never be safe even if you're in the Gates
Give it up, you're just some man's daughter
Never, never be safe even if you're in the Gates
Give it up, you're just some man's daughter”

Dieu tout puissant, j’te remercie pour ma naissance
Mon enfance, pour le fait que tu m’as laissé mon insouciance
J’ai connu l’essence, approcher la science, amplifié mes sens
Je connais ma chance et je te la rends
Désolé pour les fans, j’aime que ma foi, que ma femme
Et y'a pas si longtemps, je ne m’en croyais pas capable
Quand j’y pense, je pète un câble, j’aime comme a l’époque du bac à sable
L’époque des mots d’amour dans mon cartable
Mais cette inconnue, mon âme sœur est devenue palpable
Et je blague pas, mes sentiments sont implacables
Alors j’me dis si t'es pas cap, et que j’étais irrattrapable
Le malheur ne te rattrape pas, j’ai refusé le dernier appât
Et rattrapé la paix, demandé pardon
Maintenant fait les choses dans l’ordre, la misère s’accorde avec la miséricorde
À cette époque j’dansais, époque 95, des années hip-hop
J’voulais plaire comme un dingue
Tout pour les filles, obnubilé, pour ces nébuleuses, je voulais briller les brilleuses
Y m’fallait des billets, y m’fallait des filles
Y fallait qu’elles défilent, c’était le défi
Déficient pour le bon sens, j'étais débiteur, bourreau des cœurs
Mauvaise conscience
Après midi dansante, apparemment elle me dit qu’elle était là tout près de l’enceinte
Qui aurait su que cette fille serait ma femme à cet instant précis
Quand je l’ai vu, trop jeune, moi trop con, trop de frime
Je m’en excuse ma douce, tu étais trop p'tite
Je t’ai pas regardé, je t’demande pardon, j’ai failli nous rater
Ce que tu m’as appris dans ta lettre
C’est que pendant les 2 ans qui suivirent cette fête
Tu espérais qu’on se voit, qu’on se croise
C’est à moi que tu pensais dans ton lit le soir
Moi pendant ce temps là, j’perdais mon temps à traîner en bas
Devant le hall tel un zombie, j'oubliais que j'étais en vie
Tu es ma muse, mon amour
Je pense à toi tous les jours
Je prie pour que rien ne change
Sous la vigilance des anges
Tu es ma nébuleuse
Et je veux te rendre heureuse
Ta patience pour mes faiblesses
A fait que j’ai bu l’eau céleste
Donc 2 ans après, grâce à Dieu on nous a représenté
Je n’étais pas forcément prêt
Cette idylle concrète, en fait je l’ai craint
Mais t’étais juste trop belle, t’avais tout d’un ange, manquait juste les ailes
Sénégal reine, tu combles le manque de mes racines africaines
La confusion d’mes sentiments, on fait de moi pendant tout ce temps
Un être a moitié dément, heureusement tu nous aimais pour deux
Des visions furtives, combien furent elles dans ce morceau de vie
L’amour des parents, protection de leur fille
Des réminiscences de ce temps, je sens les effluves de cette frustration
J’t’ai vu grandir, tu m’as fait mûrir, ma puce, mon amour
Ta patience pour nous, on fait que tous les jours je pensais à toi
Mais tes parents m'voulaient pas
Quelque part je les comprends
Quelque part je les comprends
Quelque part je les comprends
Tu es ma muse, mon amour
Je pense à toi tous les jours
Je prie pour que rien ne change
Sous la vigilance des anges
Tu es ma nébuleuse
Et je veux te rendre heureuse
Ta patience pour mes faiblesses
A fait que j’ai bu l’eau céleste
(Quand j’ai pris ma plume, j’ai écrit à son père les raisons de mon envie
Lui raconte mon enfance, lui raconte ma vie
Comme dans les contes demande la main de sa fille
J’augmente mon dîme, ma foi en Dieu devient ultime
Je parle, je pense, j’espère, je prie pour qu’il m’accepte dans sa famille)
Aujourd’hui nous sommes mariés, par la grâce de Dieu et ce courrier
Amine, ma muse, pour chaque faute je m’excuse
Pour tous les couples qui me comprennent
Pour ceux qui aspirent à ça en scred
Je viens vanter les bienfaits du mariage, pur, sous la vigilance des anges
Pour toutes les âmes en peines, je suis droit et juste, laissez moi en paix
Ma femme écoute bien cette phrase :
""Lorsqu’on éduque un homme, on éduque un être
Lorsqu’on éduque une femme, on éduque un peuple.""
Tu es ma muse, mon amour
Je pense à toi tous les jours
Je prie pour que rien ne change
Sous la vigilance des anges
Tu es ma nébuleuse
Et je veux te rendre heureuse
Ta patience pour mes faiblesses
A fait que j’ai bu l’eau céleste"

You gone do some dirt then do it by yourself
You a made nigga you don't really need no help
You don't pay niggas you just fade em by yourself
If them niggas looking for you they can find you by yourself
Shots intended for my family and me
Pillow talking with them bitches ain't no family to me
I'm on the news the only time you see some cameras on me
I'm screaming free unk til its backwards til my uncle is free
Running through the cut at night you just might run into me
Im robbing all the brothers blind thats how i made enemies
Gripping on that deuce-five walking through the city
Police come through checking pockets put it in her titties
Run forrest run go
Been doing this shit way long
Trapping out the bando
Paint a picture vangogh
She sucking dick in the rain thats what you call a damn hoe
Thats what you call a damn hoe
Get it
Society swear that kako is a menace so its nothing personal
It is just business
I'm focused on winning
I swear Ima get it
You front me the work and i swear ima flip it
Aye i swear ima flip it
 X2
Running out of time ain't got no patience for niggas
She'll set the brother up and then go pray for the nigga
The doors open to a portion ain't no way for them niggas
While they sit back and debate how much they hate on a nigga
""We both Messi in the field its the same game but different goals""
In a different hood with the same gang but different bros
Never cross my niggas it's Gang Gang stick to the code
It's gang gang stick to the code
Get hurt if you step in my lane nigga
No lane switching
Man I get tired of these lame niggas
No brain with em
""K k k I can't hang with em""
""I'm used to breaking shit down they say that I changed on em
Now do that make sense to you phony niggas""
It's not common that you got it
All you got is a problem
That you can't fuck with
Me in the booth is somebody you can't be stuck with
""Mr lightyear im buzzing beats I'm on my clutch shit""
Full clip
I spit more than Daffy Duck lips
A facelift is what you need after this right hit
Ignite this bomb as flow hit like a night stick
Righteous nigga i am you cannot hype this
A physic spitting that tight shit u can’t deny this
They say we the lyrical gods yea that's a nice fit
Tryna blow like isis
And the cuban missile crisis
I just
Wanna be the best that ever tried it
Did it
Past tense when I'm spitting my vision
I'm serious
Competition ain't with it
Gone be the best when I'm finish
End of story it's ended
Yea
End of story it's ended

I think my mind may also be gone

Is what I need to borrow
Just to level it out and make a new plan
Seems of me just to fall apart
To tremble and cower
So, I pray my eyes and ears will be last

See nobody go anymore
When colours start to bleed on the floor
Now flow us through

I see your colour in the morning Sun
Somewhere over the ocean

Rain in the southeast
Men feeling blue
Men with their bowlers
Kids with their spats
Ladies with chauffeurs
Dogs wearing hats and jackets
Rich apartments
Old punk posters
Tartan garments

I love the camp as camp parade

The sun in the east
I've got a job on
For a Senegalese rich arbitrator
In African law
To paint his apartment, strip down the walls
Came down between us lately
Lust and want and need just caved in
'Is it wise?'
The answer's no
It never is but since you ask
We pause thoughtfully, for twenty seconds reprieve
Then it's off with the briefs

Sin is my game
We'll all be lined up
Irrelevant fame
Next to the broker, the nurse and the drunk

Had a good time

Egotistic swine to all your friends
